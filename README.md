# LAMP Backup Script

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a simple Bash script that I use to automatically back up my LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl) stack every 5 hours. It's a handy tool to ensure I don't lose any important website data.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lamp-backup-script.git
cd lamp-backup-script
```

2. Configure the Script

Open the lamp_backup.sh script in your favorite text editor. You'll find some variables at the beginning that you can customize:

```bash

# Variables
backup_dir="/path/to/backup"
vhost_path="/etc/apache2/sites-available"
website_files="/var/www/html"
db_user="your_mysql_user"
db_password="your_mysql_password"
db_name="your_database_name"
```
Update these variables with your specific LAMP setup details.
3. Make the Script Executable

```bash

chmod +x lamp_backup.sh
```
4. Schedule the Script

Open your crontab file:

```bash

crontab -e
```
Add the following line to run the script every 5 hours:

```bash

0 */5 * * * /path/to/lamp_backup.sh
```
Save and exit the crontab file.
Important Notes

    Make sure you have the necessary privileges to perform backups.
    Confirm that MySQL is configured to allow password-less execution of mysqldump.
    Adjust paths and variables in the script according to your specific LAMP setup.
